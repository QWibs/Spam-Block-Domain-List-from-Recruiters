We've seen  them, we've experienced their unprofessional activities as they email, call and text us about jobs that either don't exist or have no where near the requirements we're looking for as technology professionals.
As a tech professional, I offer this advice along with this spam list (mostly from india unfortunatley): Never put your cell # on a resume. Use email only, preferably a disposable one. These people will harrass you for YEARS if they have your number.
If you are interested in adding to this list of job spammers, please let me know.
